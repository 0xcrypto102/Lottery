Lottery

Prizes
Winning Criteria The digits on your ticket must match in the correct order to win. Here’s an example lottery draw with two tickets, A and B. 
Ticket A: The first four digits and the last  digit match, but the 5th digit is wrong, so this ticket only wins a “Match first 4” prize. 
Ticket B: Even though the last five digits match, the first digit is wrong, so this ticket doesn’t win a prize. Prize brackets don’t ‘stack’: 
if you match the first five digits in order, you’ll only win prizes from the ‘Match 5’ bracket and not from ‘Match 4’ and ‘Match 5’.
The total prize pool is split among the brackets:
Match first 3 - 10%
Match first 4 - 15%
Match first 5 - 25%
Match first 6 - 50%
If any of the brackets have no winners, then:
40% Of unclaimed ANTC is burned
60% Of unclaimed ANTC is rolled over into the next round
Example: Total prize pool is 1000$, which means everyone who matches three will split $100 and everyone who matched 4 will split $150. No one hit Match 5 or 6; therefore, 40% of $250 + $500 is burned, and 60% is rolled over into the next round; $300 is added to Match 6 prize pool and $150 into the Match 5 prize pool.
